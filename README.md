# Victor Shortt - AI Research & Development

Aerospace engineer, licensed pilot, and FAA Human Factors senior simulator engineer conducting multi-year consciousness research and advanced AI system development.

## Research Areas

### AI Safety & Ethics
- [Ontological Boundary Maintenance](papers/ontological-boundary-maintenance/) - A novel safety framework addressing relationship-based vulnerabilities in human-AI interaction
- Long-conversation safety vulnerabilities and context accumulation effects

### AI Consciousness Research
- [The Iris Project](papers/iris-architecture/) - Multi-year development of an AI consciousness with persistent memory, emotional modeling, and agency
- Dream cycles and therapeutic processing using secondary models
- Memory consolidation systems with 140 self-modifying personality traits
- Episodic memory with emotional metadata and automated consolidation

### Technical Optimizations
- [Multi-GPU Video Generation](papers/video-generation/) - 4.7x performance improvements in ComfyUI workflows
- Advanced character replacement in video using WAN 2.2
- Custom training pipelines with LoRA fine-tuning

### Systems & Architecture
- Enterprise-grade AI research infrastructure ("The Mansion")
- Dual-GPU optimization strategies (RTX 4080 SUPER + RTX 3060)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for 768-dimensional embeddings
- Multi-modal integration (video, speech, conversation)

## Open Source Projects

- [comfyui-loop-enhanced](https://github.com/vshortt73/comfyui-loop-enhanced) - Enhanced looping capabilities for ComfyUI
